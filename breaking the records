Maria plays college basketball and wants to go pro. Each season she maintains a record of her play. She tabulates the number of times she breaks her season record for most points and least points in a game. Points scored in the first game establish her record for the season, and she begins counting from there.

Example

Scores are in the same order as the games played. She tabulates her results as follows:

                                     Count
    Game  Score  Minimum  Maximum   Min Max
     0      12     12       12       0   0
     1      24     12       24       0   1
     2      10     10       24       1   1
     3      24     10       24       1   1
Given the scores for a season, determine the number of times Maria breaks her records for most and least points scored during the season.

def breakingRecords(scores):
    # Initialize the counters and the first score as both min and max scores
    minCount = 0
    maxCount = 0
    minScore = scores[0]

    # Loop through the scores starting from the second one
    for i in range(1, len(scores)):
        if scores[i] < minScore:  # New lowest score
            minScore = scores[i]
            minCount += 1
        elif scores[i] > maxScore:  # New highest score
            maxScore = scores[i]
            maxCount += 1

    return minCount, maxCount

# Example call with a scores list
scores = [10, 5, 20, 20, 4, 5, 2, 25, 1]
print(breakingRecords(scores))  # Output will be (4, 2)
